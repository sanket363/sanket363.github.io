Installing terraform on Centos 7
<br>
<br>
1. Open a terminal on your CentOS 7 machine.
<br>
<br>
2. Update your system's package manager by running the following command:
<br>sudo yum update
<br>
<br>
3. Install the necessary packages required for Terraform by running the following command:
<br>sudo yum install -y unzip wget
<br>
<br>
4. Download the latest version of Terraform for Linux 64-bit from the official website by running the following command:
<br>wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.0.11/terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip
<br>
Note: Please ensure that you have the latest version of Terraform by checking the official website.
<br>
<br>
5. Unzip the downloaded Terraform package by running the following command:
<br>unzip terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip
<br>
<br>
6. Move the Terraform binary to a directory in your system's PATH variable so that it can be executed from any directory. For example, you can move it to the /usr/local/bin directory by running the following command:
<br>sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
<br>
<br>
7. Verify that Terraform has been installed correctly by running the following command:
<br>/usr/local/bin/terraform --version
<br>
<br>
8. This should display the version number of Terraform that you just installed.
<br>
<br>
That's it! You have successfully installed Terraform on CentOS 7.
